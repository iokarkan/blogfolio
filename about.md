### Hi ðŸ‘‹! Welcome to my personal internet corner!

<img class="mx-auto w-1/2 rounded-full" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/pop-art.jpg">

My name is Ioannis (John) Karkanias, a **Physics PhD** with a passion for **Machine Learning** and computational **statistics**. I list some details on my background below, but my current interests revolve around Python and Machine Learning.

<!-- TODO: Education and work summary -->

### Blogging

I use a blog to communicate and share my interests, as well as my tinkering, hoping to help or inspire others as I have been aided and inspired by similar outlets!
