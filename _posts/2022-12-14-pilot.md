title: An ode to (practical) scientific communication

It is without question the field whose developments are communicated the most that feels more natural to approach for an outsider. After all, had there not been value in the advances of a field, it would not have gained traction, followers and students. And it is this reality that separates immediate from diffused value, that sets apart the engineering from the theoretical sciences, and those scholars that can only hope to see their life's work bear fruit. Take a moment and think about the number of journalist articles on recent cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence breakthroughs that one may have come by during 2022, and compare it with the equivalent of articles describing the rationale and results behind major research vectors in mathematics, theoretical physics or archaeology.

In fact, using the New York Times API, one can do a quick fact-check on the above remark. Searching in NYT articles of the past 5 years, one can count how many articles contain each keyword in the body:

|  Keyword | Hits
|---|---|
|Artificial Intelligence   | 3058
|Archaeology   |  1268

Journalistic coverage of science is one thing, and it has evolved to mostly inform and motivate. Education is a different beast, often understood wearing its 'formal' attire of academic gowns and holding scrolls. And although an argument can be made about bringing formal education to a wider audience in the 21st century, it pales in comparison to the inclusivity enabled by online resources. Switching over from a Physics post-graduate theoretical background with previously little to no knowledge of computer science, I owe plenty to wikis, open source documentation, forums, videos, blogs and communities that tutor and offer guidance. Although, definitively, it is always useful to keep a reference textbook in handy (academic habits are hard to drop), recommendation algorithms have all but eradicated the worry in searching for practical answers, which one can count has already been asked, investigated and answered to a degree.

And while the Q&A style is fast and reliable, a *story* can be much more relatable and relay the process. This should be why blogs still shine when a new field is explored from scratch, and people rush to experiment and discover. In a sequence that much resembles academic research, such posts set forward and summarize a goal, take the reader through the rational selection of tools to use to approach it, and craft the step-by-step procedure to achieve it. The focus is on the learning aspect. But it is not only the reader that benefits, and as with all such efforts with pedagogical character, it is also the creator - the story teller.

> These things are kind of fun and delightful. It doesn't do any harm to think them over again. Is there a better way to present them? Are there any new problems associated with them? Are there any new thoughts you can make about them? The elementary things are easy to think about; if you can't think of a new thought, no harm done;

Putting poetic quotes aside, I have personally struggled to truly resonate with this point of view of content creation. This practical scientific story-telling is sort of a meditative way of thinking about learning and teaching, and in its core it's a very colorful way to benefit by sharing. And while my intention is to put together a series of posts lying more on the technical side, I could not hold back the urge to preface them with this little piece. I consider it my paying respect to the teachers and collaborators I've never met!
