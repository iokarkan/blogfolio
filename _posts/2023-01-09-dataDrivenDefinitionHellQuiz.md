## What's that?

An attempt to come up with a term describing the confusion arising from the ease with which terms are thrown around in
today's data-related
job landscape.

A justified reason, of course, is the need for non-technical recruiters to apply filters to perform their job. I believe
this is nothing to poke fun at. What I believe can be poked fun at, however, is the directives that trickle down and
shape job postings, conversations and positions as a result of trend hunting.

To emphasize 'fun' rather than 'poke', I tried to put together a small quiz where everyone can evaluate their knowledge
and opinions on the various data-related business and technical roles, against a sample of the collective experience and
information
found online!

### Any take-aways?

I believe this quiz may illustrate how context-specific these definitions are. It is arguable that, if one knows
beforehand, for example, the title of the story containing a quote (i.e. how the author chooses to refer to each of the
roles compared) it would be far easier to choose correctly between the available options. 

But the fact remains, that different roles are discussed using definitions with near-perfect similarity. And while this confusion will resolve itself
significantly as time goes by, nebulous role details can only result in an overall feeling of job insecurity for new or existing employees.
