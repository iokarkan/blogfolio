## Research: Applying multivariate methods in Experimental Particle Physics Analysis

#### Tools
- numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy
- py-$$\mathtt{ROOT}$$
- Keras

#### Summary

During my doctorate research, I worked as an author of the ATLAS experiment under an analysis group focusing on a
special category of particle interactions associated with di-boson (specifically $$W^{\pm}Z$$) production and
scattering. The culmination of my thesis was to work with LHC data from the period between 2015 and 2018 to validate the
observation of a purely electroweak signal and set experimental limits for New Physics, based on an extension of terms
of the Standard Model Lagrangian of Particle Physics.

The statistical analysis compared single and multi-variate methods (traditionally Boosted Decision Trees) to an
application of Neural Network trained utilizing a selection of topological features discriminating the various exepected
theoretical signal signatures from the Standard Model background, with the resulting limits on novel interaction being
far more constrained in the latter case. Limits on the New Physics (EFT) model parameters were extracted using the
profile-likelihood ratio test statistic at a 68% and 95% C.L., being close to $$0$$ as no significant deviations in
terms of previously unobserved interactions have been found.
